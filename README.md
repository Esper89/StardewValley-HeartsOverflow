# Hearts Overflow

Hearts Overflow is a Stardew Valley mod that stores and displays hearts earned above the maximum.

When you earn friendship points with an NPC above the current maximum, Hearts Overflow will store
those points and display them as a counter of additional hearts above the normal friendship bar.
These additional friendship points are not lost if you lose friendship with the NPC or if your
maximum friendship with the NPC increases.

There is no limit to how many friendship points can be stored, although the number of hearts
displayed is limited by available screen space in the menu.

This mod should be fully compatible with any mod that doesn't extensively modify or replace the
friendship system or the social tab UI. Custom NPCs and events are compatible.
